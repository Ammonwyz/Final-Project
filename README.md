The continuous rise of housing prices has meant that currently (May 2022) Overall U.S. housing affordability is the lowest since 2008 and falling. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is above 5% and the highest since 2011, and the rise this year has been one of the fastest on record. It's both pricing out some stretched homebuyers and causing some would-be borrowers to lose their mortgage eligibility. 

As Housing accounts for around 18% of the economy in residential fixed investment and related services, this alarming rise can create a big crisis in near future.From February 2021- February 2022, in these 12 months housing prices have increased 19.2%, organization like Zillow is forecasting another 14.9% growth in next 12 months. Both of these numbers are significantly higher compared to average annual U.S. home price growth of 4.6% posted since 1987.

This situation has meant that both the housing buyers and sellers are unsure about what is an optimum price for them. In our project, we will be providing the users a recommendation based on the listing price change in last 3 years, impact of covid in housing price in that zip code and building a forecasting model factoring in the inputs mentioned above. That will help our users with the answers of how much they should be looking for if they are in the process of selling a property based on the current trend and if someone is thinking about purchasing then what the price might look like if they decide to wait.
